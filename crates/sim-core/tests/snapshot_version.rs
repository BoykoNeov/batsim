//! The bump where `Snapshot::version` finally does its job.
//!
//! # The caveat this file retires
//! Every `SNAPSHOT_VERSION` note from v3 to v9 carries the same sentence:
//!
//! > Note what actually rejects an older snapshot here: the layout change, at
//! > deserialization. **The version check never sees those bytes.**
//!
//! Under a self-describing-by-order format every one of those bumps came with a
//! structural change, so an older blob failed to *deserialize* long before
//! `Pack::restore` looked at its version field. The check was correct and untested,
//! and each note said so.
//!
//! v10 was different, and v11 is different in exactly the same way. Adding a variant to
//! an externally-tagged enum does not change how the *existing* variants serialize —
//! `CellModel::Spm` at v10, `CellModel::Dfn` at v11 — and the chemistry's `[spm]` and
//! `[dfn]` sections are both optional, so the older blob is **still structurally valid**
//! at the newer version. It would restore into a working pack whose semantics this build
//! no longer guarantees, and `Pack::restore`'s version check is the only thing standing
//! there.
//!
//! # The pair moves with the bump, rather than being renumbered
//! This file used to pin the v9 -> v10 boundary and carried an assertion saying a later
//! bump needs its own pair. This is that pair. The claim is not inheritable: that a v10
//! blob stays structurally valid under v11 is a fact about **v11's** layout change, which
//! nothing written against v10 could know. It was re-argued, not renamed.
//!
//! # The fixture is an equivalent-circuit pack, deliberately
//! Not an SPM or DFN one. The hazard is a snapshot an **older build could actually have
//! written**, and no v10 build could write a DFN pack — the variant did not exist. An
//! all-ECM pack's v11 bytes are, field for field, what v10 emitted, so retagging them to
//! 10 produces a genuine article rather than a v11 blob wearing a v10 label.
//!
//! # Why one assertion is not enough
//! "A blob tagged 9 is rejected" proves nothing on its own: it is satisfied equally
//! by the version check and by deserialization failing for an unrelated reason, which
//! is exactly the ambiguity the notes above complain about. So the test below uses
//! the **same bytes** with the version field and nothing else different. One tag must
//! be rejected and the other must restore; together they isolate the field.
